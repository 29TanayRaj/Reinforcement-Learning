## Introduction to Immediate Reinforcement learning.
- Immediate RL problems are a simplified version of RL problems where the reward is received immediately after an action.
- In standard RL, rewards can be delayed (e.g., losing an important chess piece early but only realizing the impact at the end of the game).
- In immediate RL, every action ($a_t$) taken at time $t$ results in an immediate reward ($R_t$).
- There is no temporal component: each interaction is independent, with no memory of past states or actions.

## Characteristics of Immediate RL
1. **No State Signal**  
   - The system does not have an explicit state representation.
   - The only input to the system is the reward.
   - The problem is essentially being solved repeatedly in the same conditions.

2. **Example: Drug Testing**  
   - A patient has symptoms, and the agent chooses one of four drugs.
   - If the drug works, a reward is received; if not, no reward is given.
   - However, the outcome can be **stochastic** (due to external factors).
   - A single trial is not enough to determine drug effectiveness; multiple trials are required.

3. **Stochastic Outcomes**  
   - The same action might not yield the same reward each time.
   - To handle this variability, actions must be repeated multiple times to get reliable estimates.

4. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**  
   - **Exploration**: Trying different actions to gather information.
   - **Exploitation**: Using known information to maximize rewards.
   - A balance is needed between these two, known as the **exploration-exploitation dilemma**.
   - If an agent explores too much, it wastes time; if it exploits too early, it may settle for a suboptimal solution.

5. **Formalization**  
   - Set of actions:  
     $A = \{1, 2, ..., n\}$
   - Each action $A_i$ has an associated probability of success (reward).  
   - The goal is to determine which action is best through repeated trials.

## Research and Theoretical Considerations
- Immediate RL introduces key RL concepts in a simpler setting.
- The study of immediate RL problems informs full RL problems (which include delayed rewards and state dependencies).
- The textbook provides a prescriptive algorithmic approach, but research in this area explores **why** these approaches work.
- There is active research in using insights from immediate RL for general RL problems.
- The exploration-exploitation dilemma remains a crucial research topic in RL.

## Course and Future Directions
- The instructor intends to go beyond textbook material to introduce theoretical research questions.
- Ideas from immediate RL research are influencing broader RL applications.
- There is interest in an advanced RL course covering these topics in greater depth.
